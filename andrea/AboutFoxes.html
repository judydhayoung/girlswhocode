    <h1>About Foxes</h1>
	<p>Arctic foxes are very interesting animals , because of their capability of lasting into the cold cold winter</p>

	<p>In winter they are white to blend in with the snow, while in the summer they change to brown! The Arctic fox is found throughout the entire Arctic tundra, through Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Russia, Norway, Scandinavia, and even Iceland, where it is the only native land mammal.</p>
	<p>this is a comparison of summer to winter </p>

	<p>Arctic foxes generally eat any small animal they can find, including lemmings, voles, other rodents, hares, birds, eggs, fish, and carrion. They scavenge on carcasses left by larger predators such as wolves and polar bears, and in times of scarcity even eat their feces.</p>

	<p>Polar bears, wolf packs and humans are only real predators of the adult Arctic fox, along with large birds of prey such as snowy owls, that primarily prey on the smaller and more vulnerable Arctic fox cubs.</p>
